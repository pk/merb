== Merb 1.1.0 "Black Hole" 2010-03-22

=== New Features

* Ruby 1.9 support. The big one. Merb now runs on ruby 1.9.1. This mandated some
  small changes to the internals as well as some changes to the specs. However,
  it shouldn't require any changes in your app level code, or at least the merb
  specific parts of your app level code.

* Dependency handling with bundler. This is a breaking change. But it
  should be for the better. Bundler replaces the previous dependencies.rb with a
  Gemfile. It also replaces the Thor tasks for freezing gems. The Gemfile is
  used to work out dependencies before any code is required. This avoids much of
  the dependency hell.

* Unicorns! Merb is now better behaved as a rack app and works with a config.ru
  file. This change should make working with whatever is the latest and
  greatest ruby webserver a lot easier.

* mongoid support for merb-auth-more's SaltedUser class. Thanks to anvar for
  the patch.

* asset timestamping for static assets. This appends a short query string to
  static assets, allowing long cache expiry times to be set. Thanks for pavel
  for this patch.

* Bugfixes. So many bug fixes. As part of the release process we've done our
  best to clear out many of the bugs which have been gathering dust over the
  past year. Some do still remain, but those generally require a more complex
  solution which needs some thought.


=== Dependency handling using Bundler

In this version we dropped the old way of loading dependencies using the Kernel
extensions and started to use Bundler for dependency management. This allows
us to move the whole dependency handling and gem management outside the
Merb. Therefore we can simplify some internals and remove some of the Kernel
monkey patching:

The old Kernel.dependency and Kernel.dependencies will only 'require
gem_name' or 'require require_as' when you call these methods. They will loudly
inform you of the fact via depreciation warnings too. If you see the warning,
you should move your dependency to the Gemfile.

Also methods: use_orm, use_test, use_testing_framework and use_template_engine
DON'T require any gems now, you must add them as dependencies in the Gemfile.

Merb generators was changed to generate you Gemfile for your application and
settings instead of the dependencies.rb.

So what still works? Almost everything except it doesn't defer to the Merb
start and doesn't load exact version of gem if more versions are installed:

dependency "json"                           => works
dependency "rspec", :require_as => 'spec'   => works try to require 'spec'
dependency "json", '1.1.6'                  => works unless you have
                                               >= 1.1.6 installed
dependency "json" { }                       => works but doesn't yield
